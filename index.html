          *The Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) (airbags) affords the driver
          and the front passenger additional protection in moderate to severe
          frontal and side-impact collisions, and outboard 2nd-row passengers
          additional protection in moderate to severe side-impact collisions.
          This system provides supplemental protection only, and seat belts must
          be worn in order to avoid injuries to out-of-position occupants upon
          bag deployment and to provide the best combined protection in a
          serious accident. Children should always be properly restrained in the
          rear seat.
